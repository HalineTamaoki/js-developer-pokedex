# Pokedex

This project was part of DIO (Digital Innovation One) code challenge. The challenge was consuming the pokeAPI and build my own Pokedex, with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>

## Running

Run the application withÂ `http-server ./`Â command. 

```shell
http-server ./
```

Ps: to run the project you must have the http-server npm installed. To do this, just run npm install http-server.

Hope you like ðŸ˜ƒ
